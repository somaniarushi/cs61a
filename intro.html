        <br>
        <p>Hello, and welcome! To freshmen joining Berkeley, congratulations! Get ready for the craziest 4 years of your life. </p>
        <p>To all of you, welcome to your amazing journey through 61A. </p>
        <h2 id="first-and-foremost">First and Foremost</h2>
        <p>Here&#39;s my email: <code>arushisomani@berkeley.edu</code>. Please, please, <em>please</em> reach out. I can&#39;t help you if I don&#39;t know you need help. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="the-purpose">The Purpose</h2>
        <p>The point of 61A is to make you great thinkers of Computer Science first, and great programmers second.</p>
        <p>The concepts are hard and abstract and, gotta be honest, occassionally annoying. My hope is for you to <strong>see how this class is the foundation on which your CS journey is based.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
        <p>Check out Lecture 0 for more.</p>
        <p>You may be feeling overwhelmed by the amount of activities that 61A has. Word of advise –– don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not expected to do all of them. <strong>The purpose of this overflow of info is not to scare you away but to let you know that you have as much support as you need and more.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="my-approach">My Approach</h2>
        <p>Throughout our discussions, I hope to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>- Show you how the concepts that you are learning are applied in real life</li>
        <li>- Teach you how to think critically and break down problems</li>
        <li>- Teach you to built up smaller pieces into impressive large, cohesive programs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And, of course,</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Make you the best 61A student that you can be.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>You get as much out of this class as you put in.</li>
        <li>If you <em>ever</em> need help of any sort, you can reach out to me. Class related or not. <strong>I&#39;m invested in your success.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p id="all-the-best-and-go-bears-">All the best, and Go Bears!</p>
